Build
-----

For building and running from source you need to install erlang and rebar3,
check the [Rebar3 website](http://rebar3.org) for rebar3 installation
instructions, if you are on debian or ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install erlang erlang-dev erlang-eunit
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rebar3/rebar3
    chmod u+x rebar3

You can put it in a folder in your $PATH or inside this repo and run all the
rebar3 commands relative to the current folder (./rebar3 *command*).


then:

    rebar3 compile

Run
---

    rebar3 run

Usage
-----

You need to install and run Sonic Pi, for that check the [Sonic Pi Website](http://sonic-pi.net/).

To start just the Sonic Pi server without the user interface you need to run
the server script, on ubuntu run:

    /usr/lib/sonic-pi/server/bin/sonic-pi-server.rb

If you are running in another OS search on the sonic pi installation.

Start the sonic blocks server and open http://localhost:8080/ui/index.html in your browser.

Play with the blocks and click the **Play** Button

Sonic Pi can be running in another computer, for that just change the Host and
Port config in the UI to the host and port where Sonic Pi is running.

---------------------------------------

If you are trying to run it on linux and have pulseaudio installed read the
following resources to try o make it work:

Technology
----------

Frontend is plain vanilla js, you can find the code at apps/sbs/priv/assets/

The backend runs on top of [Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy), it
uses the [erlang\_osc library](https://hex.pm/packages/erlang_osc) to talk to
Sonic Pi.

The backend is programmed in [efene](http://efene.org) a language for the Erlang VM.
